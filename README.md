# run-visualizer
An interactive website that uses data from the Strava API to breakdown details for all my runs.

See at https://strava-run-visualizer.cyclic.cloud (URL may be down sometimes, Cyclic's logs say its a starting issue, still looking into it)

Not using React for this was somewhat of a mistake...
